Task 19: Stored Procedure Objective: 

Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system. 

Description: Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance.

The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter. 

The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes'). 

If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'. 

If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.
